## 1. Introduction

The **AODB Admin Portal** (also called **ADNexx**) is the central management system for all reference and configuration data used by the Airport Operational Database (AODB). It is used to maintain accurate, up-to-date information that feeds into other airport systems such as:

- **FIDS** — Flight Information Display System
- **RMS** — Resource Management System
- **Slot Allocation** applications

**Why this data matters:**  
Any change made in this portal (e.g., adding a new airline, updating a terminal) is reflected in real-time across all connected airport systems. It is therefore important to ensure all data entered is accurate and verified before saving.

---

## 2. Roles and Access Levels

There are three user roles in the portal. Your role determines what you can see and do.

| Role | What You Can Do |
|---|---|
| **ADMIN** | Full access — create, edit, activate/deactivate, manage users and tenants, bulk upload |
| **OPERATOR** | Can view all data and edit most records. Cannot manage users. |
| **VIEWER** | Read-only access. Can search and view records but cannot make changes. |

> **Note:** If you are a VIEWER, the "Add New", "Edit", and toggle buttons will not appear on your screen. Contact your ADMIN if you need higher access.

---

## 3. Logging In

### Steps

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the AODB portal URL provided by your IT team.
2. You will see the **Login screen**.
3. In the **"Username or Email"** field, enter your username or registered email address.
4. In the **"Password"** field, enter your password.  
   - You can click the **eye icon** (👁) on the right side of the password field to show or hide your password.
5. Click the **"Sign In"** button.
6. If your credentials are correct, you will be taken to the **Dashboard** automatically.

### If login fails

- Double-check your username/email and password. Passwords are case-sensitive.
- If you see the error **"Username or email is required"** — the username field is empty.
- If you see the error **"Password is required"** — the password field is empty.
- If you see a server error — your account may be locked or your credentials may be incorrect. Contact your system administrator.

> **Security tip:** Never share your login credentials. Your session is stored only for the duration of your browser session. Closing the browser or tab will log you out automatically.

---

## 4. Dashboard Overview

After logging in, you land on the **Dashboard — Master Data Administration** page.

### What you see on the Dashboard

**Information Banner:**  
At the top, there is a blue information bar reminding you that:
> *"All entities below feed into the AODB operational database. Changes here propagate to FIDS, RMS, and Slot applications in real-time. Ensure all reference data is accurate before activating operational modules."*

**Module Cards:**  
The main area shows a grid of cards, one for each data module. Each card displays:
- The **module name** (e.g., Airlines, Airports)
- A short **description** of what the module contains
- The **total count** of records in that module (e.g., "142 Airlines")
- A small **coloured icon** identifying the module category

Clicking any card takes you directly to that module.

**Available modules on the Dashboard:**

| Module | Category | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Airlines | Reference Data | IATA/ICAO codes, types, alliances |
| Airports | Reference Data | Codes, timezone, coordinates |
| Aircraft Types | Reference Data | Dimensions, wake category |
| Countries | Reference Data | ISO country reference data |
| Terminals | Infrastructure | Terminal buildings |
| Gates | Infrastructure | Boarding gates |
| Stands | Infrastructure | Apron stands |
| Runways | Infrastructure | Runway designators and dimensions |
| Baggage Belts | Infrastructure | Arrivals/departures belts |
| Check-in Desks | Infrastructure | Desk types, counters, airlines |
| Ground Handlers | Operations | GHA companies and contacts |
| Delay Codes | Operations | IATA + custom delay codes |
| Users | System (Admin only) | Platform users, roles, access |
| Tenants | System | Multi-tenancy configuration |

---

## 5. Understanding the Portal Layout

The portal has two main areas:

### Left Sidebar (Navigation)

The **left sidebar** is always visible and lets you jump between modules. It is organised into sections:

| Sidebar Section | Modules |
|---|---|
| **OVERVIEW** | Dashboard |
| **REFERENCE DATA** | Airlines, Airports, Aircraft Types, Countries |
| **INFRASTRUCTURE** | Terminals, Gates, Stands, Runways, Baggage Belts, Check-in Desks |
| **OPERATIONS** | Ground Handlers, Delay Codes |
| **SYSTEM** | Users (Admin only), Tenants |

- You can **collapse** the sidebar by clicking the **left arrow (‹)** button at the top right of the sidebar. This gives more room to the main content area.
- To **expand** it again, click the arrow icon that appears on the collapsed sidebar.
- At the bottom of the sidebar, you can see your **name/email** and **role**, and a **Logout** button.

### Main Content Area

The right side of the screen shows the content for the currently selected module. Every module page follows the same layout:

```
[Module Title & Subtitle]           [Template] [Bulk Upload] [Add New]
[Stats Bar — quick counts]
[Search Box]                                              [Refresh]
[─────────────────── Data Table ──────────────────────────────────]
[Column Header 1] [Column Header 2] ... [Actions]
[Row 1]                                [Edit] [Toggle]
[Row 2]                                [Edit] [Toggle]
...
[◀ Previous]  Page X of Y  [Next ▶]
```

---

## 6. Common Actions Across All Modules

Every module follows the same patterns for the actions below.

---

### 6.1 Searching for Records

1. In the **Search box** (top-left of the table), type any keyword — e.g., an airline name, IATA code, or country name.
2. The table filters **instantly** as you type. No need to press Enter.
3. To clear the search, delete the text from the search box.

> **Example:** In the Airlines module, typing "Air India" or just "AI" will show all matching airline records.

---

### 6.2 Adding a New Record

1. Click the **"Add [Module Name]"** button in the top-right corner (e.g., "Add Airline", "Add Airport").
2. A **form panel** (modal window) will open with all the fields for that module.
3. Fill in the required fields. Fields marked with a **red asterisk (\*)** are mandatory.
4. Some fields have **hints** shown in smaller text below them (e.g., "2-letter code e.g. AI") — follow these guides.
5. Once all required fields are filled, click the **"Save"** button at the bottom of the form.
6. A green **success notification** will appear at the top of the screen confirming the record was created.
7. The table will automatically update to show the new record.

> **If Save fails:** A red error notification will appear with the reason. Correct the highlighted field and try again.

---

### 6.3 Editing a Record

1. Find the record you want to edit in the table (use Search if needed).
2. Click the **pencil icon (✏)** in the **Actions** column on the right side of that row.
3. The same form will open, pre-filled with the existing data.
4. Make your changes.
5. Click **"Save"** to confirm.
6. A green success notification confirms the update.

> **Note:** The record ID (internal system identifier) cannot be changed. Only the data fields can be edited.

---

### 6.4 Activating / Deactivating a Record

Many modules support activating or deactivating a record without deleting it. This is useful when a gate, belt, or runway is temporarily out of service but should be kept in the system.

1. Find the record in the table.
2. Look at the **Actions column** — you will see a **toggle switch icon**.
   - A **green toggle (▶)** means the record is currently **Active**.
   - A **grey toggle (◀)** means the record is currently **Inactive**.
3. Click the toggle to switch the status.
4. A notification confirms the change.

> **Example use case:** A baggage belt goes offline for maintenance. Click the toggle to mark it Inactive. When maintenance is complete, click it again to reactivate it.

---

### 6.5 Refreshing the Page

Click the **Refresh** button (circular arrow icon, top-right of the search bar) to reload the latest data from the server. Use this if you think someone else has made changes and you want to see the most current data.

---

### 6.6 Navigating Multiple Pages

If a module has many records, they are split into multiple pages.

- At the bottom of the table, you will see: **◀ Previous | Page X of Y | Next ▶**
- Click **Next ▶** to go to the next page.
- Click **◀ Previous** to go back.

---

### 6.7 Downloading a CSV Template

Before doing a **Bulk Upload** (see next section), you should download the official template to ensure your data is in the correct format.

1. Go to the module page (e.g., Airlines).
2. Click the **"Template"** button (with a download arrow icon, ↓) in the top-right area.
3. Your browser will download a `.csv` file named after the module (e.g., `airlines.csv`).
4. Open the file in Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or any spreadsheet application.
5. The first row contains the **column headers** — do not change or delete these.
6. The remaining rows are **example data** showing the correct format. Replace them with your actual data.
7. Save the file in CSV format when done.

---

### 6.8 Bulk Uploading Records via CSV

> **Available to: ADMIN role only.**

Instead of adding records one by one, you can upload many records at once using a CSV file.

1. Prepare your CSV file using the template (see Section 6.7 above).
2. Go to the module page where you want to upload records.
3. Click the **"Bulk Upload"** button (upload icon, ↑) in the top-right area.
4. A file picker will open. Select your prepared CSV file.
5. The system will process the file. The button will show **"Uploading…"** while in progress.
6. When complete, a green **"Bulk Upload Complete"** notification will appear, and the table will refresh automatically.

> **If the upload fails:** A red error notification will appear with details. Common causes:
> - Wrong column headers (always use the downloaded template)
> - Missing required fields (e.g., blank IATA code)
> - Duplicate records that already exist in the system

## 11. Logging Out

To log out of the portal:

1. Look at the **bottom of the left sidebar**.
2. Click the **"Logout"** button (door/exit icon).
3. You will be taken back to the Login page immediately.

> **Important:** The portal uses **session-based storage**. This means your login is automatically cleared when you close the browser tab or window. You do not need to manually log out when closing the browser, but it is good practice to do so on shared computers.

## 12. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: I cannot see the "Add New" button. What is wrong?**  
A: You likely have a **VIEWER** role. Viewer accounts are read-only and cannot add or edit records. Contact your ADMIN to have your role upgraded if needed.

---

**Q: I cannot see the "Users" menu item in the sidebar.**  
A: The Users module is only visible to users with the **ADMIN** role. If you need access, contact your system administrator.

---

**Q: I made a mistake in a record. Can I delete it?**  
A: The portal does not have a direct "Delete" button to prevent accidental data loss. Instead, you can **Deactivate** the incorrect record using the toggle switch, and then create a correct new record. If a record needs to be permanently removed, contact your system administrator.

---

**Q: My bulk upload CSV failed. What should I check?**  
A: Common reasons for upload failure:
1. The column headers were changed or removed — always use the **downloaded template** without altering the header row.
2. A mandatory field (like IATA code or name) was left blank in one or more rows.
3. A record already exists in the system with the same unique identifier.
4. Date fields are in the wrong format — use `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., 2024-01-15).

---

**Q: The page shows an error banner in red. What does it mean?**  
A: A red error message below the search bar means the portal could not connect to the server or the server returned an error. Try clicking the **Refresh** button. If the error persists, check your network connection or contact IT support.

---

**Q: Data I saved is not appearing in the table.**  
A: Click the **Refresh** button (circular arrow icon) to reload the latest data. If you are on page 2 or beyond, the new record may appear on a different page — try searching for it by name or code.

---

**Q: What does "Valid From / Valid To" mean on a record?**  
A: These dates define the period when a record is **operationally active**. For example, a temporary terminal opened for a season would have a Valid From of the opening date and a Valid To of the closing date. If a record is permanent, leave **Valid To** blank.

---

**Q: I cannot log in — the page says "Login failed".**  
A: Possible causes:
- Wrong username/email or password (check for CAPS LOCK).
- Your account has been deactivated — contact your ADMIN.
- The server may be temporarily unavailable — try again in a few minutes.

---

**Q: Can multiple users be logged in at the same time?**  
A: Yes. Multiple users can use the portal simultaneously. If two users edit the same record at the same time, the last save will overwrite the previous one. Always check with your team before editing shared records.
